    """Compute non-maximum suppression with variance.
    The variance of all overlapping bounding boxes and scores is computed and returned together with the kept bounding box.
    Computing the variance maintains the uncertainty corresponding to a selected bounding box.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boxes : torch.Tensor
        Tensor of size (N, 4) containing N bounding boxes with format (x1, x2, y1, y2).
    scores : torch.Tensor
        Tensor of size (N) containing the corresponding scores for the bounding boxes.
    overlap : float
        Overlap threshold for IoU computation.
    top_k : int
        Maximum number of detections to keep.

    Returns
    -------
    keep_custom : tuple
        A tuple consisting of:

            - Torch tensor of size (M) containing the indices of the M kept bounding boxes.
            - Tensor of size (M,4) containing the variance for each kept item with respect to all overlapping bounding boxes.
